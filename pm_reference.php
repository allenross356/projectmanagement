	The reference can also hold text description as well as images and other files.

	The reference creator will be notified of who all can view the reference that he created.
		
	<TODO> If the object whose reference is created is visible on the same page that the UI is displaying then the UI will simply highlight the object. If the object isn't visible on the same page, then the UI will open a reference viewer sub-window.
